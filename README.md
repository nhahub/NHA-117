# 📊 Fitness Performance Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description
This project is an **end-to-end Business Intelligence solution** designed to analyze users’ fitness behavior, workout performance, and health indicators.  
The goal is to transform raw fitness data into meaningful insights that help understand activity patterns, health metrics, and training effectiveness.

The solution includes:
- Building a **structured data model** using MySQL  
- Creating **analytical SQL views**  
- Developing an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for executive reporting
